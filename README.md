# Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures
Included are exercises completed while reading Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

## What's inside:

### Chapter 1:
- A fraction data type
- A simple logic circuit implementation

### Chapter 2:
- Two different functions to find the smallest value in a list
  - Used to show that even though your function may provide the functionality you're looking for, it's not always the most efficient solution.
  
### Chapter 3:  
- Implementations of data types such as stacks, queues, deuques, unordered lists, and ordered lists.
- A simulation implementing a queue where a computer printer must make its way through it's print jobs over a time period.

### Chapter 4 (in progress):
- Simple recursive algorithm implementations to:
  - Reverse a string.
  - Return the sum of a list of integers.
  - Convert an integer into it's string representation of any base.
  - Check if a string is a palindrome.
  
## Note 
I am still in the progress of working through this book and new code will be added daily
